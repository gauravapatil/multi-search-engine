**Multi-Search Engine**
Multi-Search Engine is a web application that lets users choose from three custom search pages powered by APIs: Google, Gemini, and Wikipedia. 
Instead of using the default search interfaces of these platforms, users can select an option and be redirected to a search page that uses the respective API to handle their queries.

**Description**
The Multi-Search Engine project provides an interface where users can select between three custom search pages. 
Each search page uses the API of the chosen search engine (Google, Gemini, or Wikipedia) to perform searches. 
This allows users to stay within your application's ecosystem while utilizing different search technologies.
